## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Stylus

### What I learned

This was my first time installing stylus on a project, I learn how to use it and how to set it up with the `package.json`

Here is how I set up a command to compile and watch the stylus files:

```js
"scripts": {
    "watch": "stylus -w styles/main.styl -o public/main.css"
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Stylus docs](https://stylus-docs.netlify.app/) - The official documentation of stylus, this helped me to know how to install the stylus package, and how to use it to compile from `.styl` to `.css`.

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is an amazing resource to check the documentation about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this helped to confirm the structure of the `toggle()`property of `classList`

- [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yAAV-uP0po) - This channel is great to learn how works CSS in a easy way, this video really helped understand how `object-fit` works and how to use it properly.
